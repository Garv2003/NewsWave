If she was going to do it, that's how she would do it.The source, who is said to be a friend of Catherine's, says the couple \"want to be clear and more open\", but that \"they're not going to be rushed.\" ﻿Another source told the publication that what is unfolding is exactly what they said would happen – the royal would have two weeks of recovery in hospital and then start working again after Easter.﻿READ MORE: How a single paparazzi photo broke up Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson﻿The couple may provide more insight into the royal's recovery with a photo released on ﻿April 23, marking Prince Loui's sixth birthday.An aide told the Sunday Times: ﻿\"They appreciate the public's love and affection for their children and know there is a public appetite to see them on their birthdays.\"But there is no \"firm decision\" on whether Kate will be the one to take the picture, or if they will leave it to a professional.READ MORE: Queen Elizabeth 'really rocked' by Charles and Diana's troubled marriage, royal expert saysThe rumour mill has been churning for weeks, first beginning three weeks ago when the public created wild conspiracy theories and jokes about the royal's whereabouts.It caused Kensington Palace to release a statement, with a representative telling The Sun, \"We were very clear from the outset that the Princess of Wales was out until after Easter and Kensington Palace would only be providing updates when something was significant.\"﻿Then came the paparazzi shot in the car and soon after the highly discussed photoshopped snap of the mum with her three children creating even more of a frenzy.﻿﻿For a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter hereKate apologised for the gaffe via an Instagram story. In a post on the Prince and Princess of Wales' official social media accounts, Kate said that \"like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing\".\"I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused,\" she signed off the message with her initial, C.",
